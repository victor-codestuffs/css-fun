# Fun with CSS

An CSS 101 and CSS 102 presentation and activity. Huzzah! 

## Getting started

1. `npm install`
2. `grunt start`
3. Check the LiveReload widget in Chrome.

### Demo!
This will open up a demo page in Chrome; resize the browser width from small to large for some Cave Story action.

### Activity!
Navigate to `/practice.html` for super fun time. Your goal is to fix `practice.sass`, which will compile when correct and get the page to show a secret message when resizing the browser. View `solution.sass` for the answer.
